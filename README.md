# Cipher_Encryption_Decryption

Encryption and Decryption: The technique of transforming a normal communication (plaintext) into a meaningless message is known as encryption (Ciphertext). Decryption, on the other hand, is the process of returning a meaningless communication (ciphertext) to its original form (Plaintext).

What is Cipher?
Ciphers, often known as encryption algorithms, are data encryption and decryption methods. A Cipher uses a key to determine how to turn the original communication, known as plaintext, into ciphertext. 

What is Caesar Cipher?
Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cypher in which each letter in plain text is substituted by another letter from the alphabet at some predefined positions.
The Caesar Cipher encryption rule can be expressed mathematically as: 
c = (x + n) % 26

The same for the decryption process is: 
x = (c - n) % 26

This Project includes encryption and decryption process of Caesar Cipher in Python.
